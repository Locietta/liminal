This is a concise code style guide for the Liminal project. Contributors or agents should follow these guidelines unless there is a compelling reason to deviate.

If not specified here, just follow the code style of the existing code around the code you are writing.

## Formatting

Run `pixi run format <paths...>` to format specific files or directories. Pass `--language <cpp|python|markdown|json|toml>` to override language detection for every input.

## Identifier Naming

See [.clang-tidy](../.clang-tidy).

## Header Inclusion

The headers should be grouped with the following order:

```c++
/// interface header of the current .cpp file
#include "interface.h"

// std headers
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

// other 3rd party headers
#include <fmt/format.h>

// other headers from the Liminal project
#include <lighter/http/client.h>
#include <lighter/async/async.h>
```

## Structs, Custom Types

Always use `struct`, do not use `class` for custom types. This way, we don't need to write `public:` for every struct, and when we need to inherit, we don't need to write `public` in the inheritance list.

## Polymorphism

We generally avoid virtual functions in this project. If you need polymorphism, use `ngcpp-proxy` (previously `microsoft-proxy`). It provide a dynamic dispatch mechanism based on fat pointers, much close to rust's trait objects. It can also support static dispatch with `PRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH` and `PRO_DEF_FREE_DISPATCH`. An example:

```c++
struct RenderContext {};

PRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(DrawDispatch, draw); // generate a templated dispatch funtion draw at global scope

inline constexpr DrawDispatch draw{};

struct DrawableFacade
    : pro::facade_builder
        ::add_convention<
            DrawDispatch,
            void(RenderContext&) const>
        ::build
{};

struct Mesh {
    void draw(RenderContext&) const
    {
        // ...
    }
};

template<class T>
concept Drawable = requires(
    const T& value,
    RenderContext& ctx)
{
    { draw(value, ctx) } -> std::same_as<void>;
};

void render_static(
    const Drawable auto& value,
    RenderContext& ctx)
{
    draw(value, ctx);        // statically dispatched
}

void render_dynamic(
    const pro::proxy<DrawableFacade>& value,
    RenderContext& ctx)
{
    draw(*value, ctx);       // dynamically dispatched by Proxy
}
```

This way we can keep the main structs in our codebase as plain non virtual structs, with better memory layout and data locality, and still have polymorphism when needed.

## Callable Wrappers

Use the standard callable wrappers according to ownership:

- Use `std::copyable_function` for owning callbacks that are copied.
- Use `std::move_only_function` for owning callbacks that are transferred or may capture move-only state.
- Use `std::function_ref` only for synchronous, non-storing callback parameters whose target is guaranteed to outlive the call.

## Basic Types

We have some short convenience types defined in `lighter/types.hpp`, use them over the standard types. (e.g. use `usize` instead of `std::size_t`).

These types should be direcly available inside the `lighter` namespace, if you are in a different namespace, `using namespace lighter::types;` is generally recommended.

## Assertions, Contracts and Panic

Do not use `<cassert>` or `assert()`. Use C++26 contracts for programmer obligations and internal invariants:

- Use `pre` and `post` for interface-level preconditions and postconditions. Place them on the first declaration, normally in the public header, and do not repeat them on an out-of-line definition.
- Use `contract_assert` for internal invariants at a particular point in an implementation.

Production builds use `-fcontract-evaluation-semantic=ignore`, while development and test builds use `enforce`. Consequently, correctness in production must not depend on a contract predicate being evaluated.

Use `lighter::check(condition, message)` for conditional failures that must remain checked in production. Use `lighter::panic(message)` for unconditional fatal paths. Prefer `lighter::check` over an `if` statement whose only purpose is to call `lighter::panic`.

## Error Handling

Generally we will have 3 kinds of failures in our codebase:

- **Expected failures**. These are failures that are expected to happen and should be handled by the caller. For example, a file not found error when trying to open a file. These failures should be returned as `lighter::Outcome` (or `std::expected` if cancellation is not needed).
- **Rare failures whose only sensible handler is a distant recovery boundary**. These are failures that hardly happen and cannot be handled by the immediate caller. These should be thrown as runtime exceptions.
- **Fatal failures**. These are the failures that can't be handled meaningfully anywhere in the codebase. For example, an OOM error. These should `panic` .

Distinguish these 3 kinds of failures by asking who can act on the failure. If the immediate caller can act on it, return `lighter::Outcome`. If only a distant recovery boundary can act on it, throw an exception. If no one can act on it, `panic`.
